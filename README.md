# employee-management-api

This project is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a simple API for managing employee data within an organization. The application supports user authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to various functionalities based on user roles.

## Features

- Employee Registration & Login: Employees can register for an account and log in to access their profile.
- JWT Authentication: Secure access to the API using JSON Web Tokens.
- Employee Self-Management: Any employee can view and update their own profile information.
- Admin Privileges:
  - View all employees.
  - Change employee roles.
  - Delete employee records.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd employee-management-api`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables (e.g., Port, MongoDB connection string, JWT secret). Create a `.env` file with following contents.
```
MONGO_URI="<connection-string>"
PORT=<desired-port>
JWT_SECRET=<secret-key>
```
5. Start the server: `npm run dev`

## Post-Installation

1. Register the first employee through the API.
2. Perform database seeding to assign the ADMIN role to the first employee:
